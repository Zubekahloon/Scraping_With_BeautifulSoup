# Book Scraper using BeautifulSoup
## Project Description
This Python script scrapes book data from Books to Scrape using BeautifulSoup and requests. It extracts book details such as:
**✅** Title
**✅** Price
**✅** Availability (In Stock/Out of Stock)
**✅** Book Link

The scraped data is then saved into a CSV file (books.csv) using Pandas for easy analysis.
## How It Works
**🔹** The script iterates through multiple pages of books on the website.
**🔹** It extracts book details using HTML parsing with BeautifulSoup.
**🔹** If the page does not exist (404 error), the script stops.
**🔹** The data is saved into a CSV file for further use.
